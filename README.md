# IPFSum
IPFSum is a Decentralized Accounting Platform. It is currently being developed on Laravel using MySQL, but we are still working on the use of OrbitDB. Files created on IPFSum are saved in IPFS and the file's addressees can verify the validity of this file over IPFS. For this, our integration work with Web3Storage continues.

# Developed by Who?
The project is being developed by Baran BAYDEN. But we will consider Pull Requests. In particular, we request you to develop integration according to the tax regulations of your country. Your name will be included in the IPFSum's Github Repository. After a while, we plan to turn it into a project developed entirely by the community.

# Who Can Use IPFSum?
IPFSum is more than an accounting program. In addition to invoicing, you can use modules such as stock tracking, inventory and CRM for free. All businesses, freelancers or investors who need them can use IPFSum.

# Where is IPFS used in this project?

We are developing IPFSum so that the generated files and some metadata can be kept directly in IPFS. For this you need to work with an IPFS Pinning Service, we are trying to establish full integration with Infura.io.

# Is IPFS the only Web3 technology used in the project? ðŸ˜’

No, we are working on login with Web3 wallet apps for login. In other words, the user will be able to log in either with e-mail and password, or with wallets such as Metamask.

# Why didn't you create the database directly with OrbitDB.

Accounting platforms may contain some sensitive data, but OrbitDB is still in beta and does not have a serious audit report. Therefore, we are developing with MySQL in order to offer a more useful accounting platform. However, we are planning to release the OrbitDB version in the future, depending on the preferences of the users.

# Is this project open source?

Yes, you can access all the code of the project from the Github repository.

# Will I be able to integrate applications into IPFSum with API?

Yes, this is possible! Since we are using the Laravel framework, you can use the API functions without any problems. We also plan to offer a one-click connection option with Zapier in the future.

# How do I Install?

IPFSum currently has only one installation method.

After installing the IPFSum project on your hosting server, you can follow the installation instructions from the directory www.yourdomain.com/install.

We are working on one-click installation on platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud. You will be able to get it installed from Cloud Marketplaces in the future.

However, our SaaS solution will also be available in the future.

# How can I use the mobile application?

We do not have a mobile application yet, but we have added it to our roadmap and we want to bring the mobile application to users as soon as possible.

# I don't want to set up a server myself, do you have a SaaS service?

We are developing our SaaS service. However, we also need to complete some legal procedures for SaaS. When our SaaS service is activated, we will provide you with announcements through our communication channels.

# Do you offer Installation and Support Services?

Yes, you can contact baran@baydenteknoloji.com for this.

# How can I reach you if there is a problem?

If you are using the Community version, you can submit your issues in the Issues section of the IPFSum Github Repository. Do not transmit your sensitive data from this section.

# Do you charge money for software?

No, IPFSum is free to download and install from Github, so we don't charge money for its use. If someone tried to sell IPFSum to you, please disregard and contact us.
